The heat causes the liquid's molecules to vibrate faster and faster until they break free of the rest of the molecules and float away as a gas.  In cooking, we usually use evaporation to reduce the amount of water in a liquid. Words like  simmering  and  thickening  usually mean using heat to cook a liquid - often a sauce - for a long time so that some of the liquid evaporates. When this happens, you are left with a thicker, richer sauce.  Although it might seem like evaporating a liquid makes it disappear, this is actually an example of a  reversible change . When we evaporate liquid, we can catch or trap the water vapour (for example, by putting a lid over the pot/pan). This vapour will  condense  as it cools until it becomes a liquid again.  &nbsp;    Experimental protocol    Watch your teacher demonstrate how evaporation can be used to create a sauce - or complete the experiment yourself if you can do so safely.

Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower.

In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void.

Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance.

Probably the most simple thing we know about light is that it reflects. Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all! Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do.&nbsp;    Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark? You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object.&nbsp;     Different types of reflection     When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called  specular  reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day.&nbsp;    However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles.

Specular &amp; Diffusion Reflection         &nbsp;   If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface.

They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track.

In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case.

Changes in states of matter     These three states of matter - solids, liquids, and gases - &nbsp;exist at different temperatures. This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.

Why are seeds dispersed?    You know that a plant seed is the result of a flower being pollinated, which triggers an angiosperm's reproductive process. You also know that the plant seed contains an embryo which, once it germinates, will grow to become a new plant. This represents the completion of a plant's reproductive cycle.  It would be problematic for a \u2018parent\u2019 plant if all its seeds germinated right next to it. The new plants would compete with the parent plant for light, soil nutrients, and water - so it is likely that either the parent plant or some of the new seedlings would die.&nbsp;  Plants can't move, so they have had to evolve strategies to  disperse  - or scatter - their seeds further away from them. This increases the likelihood that the plant successfully passes its genes on to the next generation.&nbsp;  There are five main strategies which angiosperms use to disperse their seeds.   Wind dispersal   With wind dispersal, seeds are blown from the plant and germinate where they land (if they land in healthy soil). To help their chances that at least some of the seeds land in a place suitable for growth, these plants have to produce lots of seeds.  Seeds that are dispersed using the wind are light and can be carried long distances. Many have evolved shapes that help them stay airborne for longer. Some plants, like kauri and maple trees, have \u2018winged\u2019 seeds. They don\u2019t float away but flutter to the ground. This softens their impact and reduces the chances of the seed being damaged.      How a Vortex Helps Dandelions Fly        Maple Seeds Falling       Water dispersal   Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal. The seeds float away from the parent plant. These plants have evolved seeds that have hard but light shells that allow them to float down streams and rivers.&nbsp;  For example, mangrove trees live in estuaries. If a mangrove seed falls during low tide, it can begin to root in the soil. If the seeds fall in the water, they are carried away by the tide to grow somewhere else.   Animal dispersal   Animals can disperse seeds both internally and externally.   Internally , animals are attracted to fruit and eat them for food. They also ingest the seeds. Most seeds will survive their journey through the digestive system due to their protective seed coat. They are then deposited in manure far away from the parent plant.      Fruit &amp; Animal Dispersal       Externally , animals can brush up against plants as they move through the undergrowth. Many plants have taken advantage of this by growing seeds as sticky or prickly  burrs  which stick to an animal's fur or feathers. They stick to the animal as it moves away from the plant and, when they eventually fall off, they are a long way from their parent plant.   Explosion   Some parent plants produce seeds in pods. When dry, these pods explode to spread their seeds as far away as possible.      Seed Dispersal by Explosion       Fire   In countries that experience regular bushfires (like Australia), some plants have adapted their seed dispersal to fire. Plants like banksias and eucalypts need the high temperatures of fires to trigger the release of their seeds.  Their seeds are often in cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin. These cones/fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin. The intensity and timing of the fire is important. It needs to be hot enough to trigger the seeds to be released, but if fires are too frequent, there is not enough time for the plants to grow big enough to make new seeds.      Why the Giant Sequoia Needs Fire to Grow       Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur/feathers, and by wind   Explain why seeds need to be dispersed far away from their parent plant   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?

Every heartbeat pushes blood from the heart through blood vessels to all parts of the body.  The heart is a complex system itself, with different components performing different functions. It has  four chambers :   The upper two chambers are called the  atria . These receive blood entering into the heart. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, ready to be pumped to the rest of the body. And the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood back from the rest of the body  The lower two chambers are called the  ventricles . These are the \u2018pumps\u2019 that push blood away from the heart. The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs. And the left ventricle receives newly-oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it around the body        Heart valves    Blood needs to flow in a specific direction in each part of the heart. This ensures that only oxygenated blood is pumped through our bodies and that only deoxygenated blood is sent to our lungs.  To ensure that blood flows in the right direction, our heart contains four  heart valves . They only allow blood flowing in a certain direction to pass through them, and they close after the blood has passed through to prevent blood flowing back in the wrong direction. They're a bit like a door that can only be pushed open, not pulled open - you can only go through it from one direction.      How the Heart Pumps Blood      The heart has two valves between the atrium and ventricle on each side of the heart:   The  tricuspid valve  separates the right atrium from the right ventricle  The  mitral/bicuspid valve  separates the left atrium from the left ventricle   The heart also has two valves between the ventricles and the largest arteries that carry blood away from the heart:   The  pulmonary/pulmonic valve  is between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs  The  aortic valve  is between the left ventricle and the aorta, which carries blood to the body     Bioninja, Heart Structure (2019).
