Google Earth - the Acropolis        Explore the Acropolis in 360\u00b0      Over the centuries in ancient Greece, the Acropolis was many things: a home to kings, a citadel, a mythical home of the gods, a religious centre, and more. It is home to several temples - the  Parthenon  is the most famous of these.  The Acropolis dates all the way back to 4000 BCE, but it was made into an amazing site that can still be appreciated today in the 5th century BCE. As the ancient Greek civilisation grew and as thought and art flourished, the Acropolis became the heart of the empire. To this day, it serves as a monument to art, architecture, and government, and is viewed as a symbol of classical spirit and civilization given to the world by the ancient Greeks.      Secrets of the Acropolis      It also is a major tourist attraction and an important contributor to Athens's economy. More than 7 million people visit it each year.

Why the past matters    We don't have any formal obligations to preserve ancient sites, unless they are protected by law. So why do we bother protecting them?&nbsp;Do ancient sites have any value for us?&nbsp;   They connect us to the past   Preserving ancient sites and objects is important when they reflect our cultural, social, economic, political, archaeological, or architectural history. This history is important because it connects us to specific times, places, and events that were significant milestones in our collective past.  Visiting these sites provides us with a sense of place, and maintains continuity between our past and our present. It helps us understand how we arrived at where and who we are today.   Social &amp; cultural benefits   A community benefits when its citizens take pride in its history and share a common desire to preserve and share their unique past. The tangible presence that ancient sites provide enriches the cultural heritage of a place and its people. They help people connect with each other and with the place that they live. It makes them feel part of something that has existed for hundreds or thousands of years.   It expands human knowledge   By studying history, we learn more about who we are and where we've come from. This grows our knowledge about our species and civilisations, which we can use to make better decisions into the future. Knowing how ancient people and societies dealt with issues in the past helps us to recognise those same issues in the present or the future. And if we know how people tried to respond to these problems in the past and what worked (and didn't work), we can use our learnings to make better decisions today.&nbsp;   Economic benefits   Maintaining and saving ancient sites creates a major demand for tourism. Visiting ancient sites provides people from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy something spectacular and learn about other cultures and their histories.  For this reason, preserving ancient sites can make a big difference to a country's economy. For example, close to 15 million people visit the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) every year! Many of these visitors would not visit Egypt if the Pyramids had not been protected and preserved.&nbsp;  Visitors who are there to see ancient sites spend money on accommodation, food and drink, and on other local wares. This creates employment for thousands of people. The act of preserving an ancient site and making it available to the public also creates many jobs for local communities (workers, cleaners, tour guides, security guards, etc).   Name a historical site you have been to, or would like to visit one day. What did you like about it, or why would you like to visit this site?   Provide three reasons for why you think it is great that this site has been preserved   Is there anything you would add to this list?

Temperature is a measure of heat in a certain place at a certain time. It's influenced by five main factors:    Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be   Altitude .  The  altitude  of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1\u00b0C    Ocean temperatures &amp; currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates   Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun   Topography (or relief) . The  aspect  of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun   The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place.

The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem?

Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow.&nbsp;    Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second! When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms.&nbsp;    This is why the Norwegian town of  Rjukan  is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town.    It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light.&nbsp;         Sundials     Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using  sundials . The oldest known  sundial  was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE.&nbsp;    A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle.       How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time       The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of  Rjukan  is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate shadows by making a human sundial     Materials         Open space with concrete or another hard surface    A clock      Chalk    Tape measure         Method      You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment.

You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby    Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It\u2019s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements    Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock    Trace your partner\u2019s shadow using sidewalk chalk &amp; write the time next to it    Measure the length of your partner\u2019s shadow and record it in your results table    Measure the distance from the last shadow    Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun.

You may want to&nbsp; check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, &amp; 3:00 PM     In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings? What direction does the shadow move across the day?   What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow? How did your shadow change throughout the day?   Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows. You can do this digitally or by hand. Save a copy of it here.

The force applied to turn the objects around the pivot or the turning force is called the  moment , or  torque .       Turning Forces       The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot. It is shown by the formula below:     Turning force (moment/torque) = Force x distance from the pivot     Turning force is measured using  Newton-metres (Nm) .   &nbsp;    Levers      First class levers  are simple machines which have the pivot between the force and the load. This allows a larger force to be applied to the load with less effort.    The effort force moves over a larger distance to move the load force over a smaller distance. As the ratio of effort (force) arm length to load arm length increases, the mechanical advantage of a first class lever increases.       How Levers Work       Seesaws used in playgrounds are an example of first class levers.

Light &amp; colour     As we saw in our properties of light experiment, visible white light is made up of a rainbow of colours. This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world.&nbsp;    Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain.        Filters     What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them? These are referred to as  filters.  A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them.&nbsp;    A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours.&nbsp;When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue. But when blue light from a blue filter hits a red object, the blue will be absorbed by the red object and no light will be reflected.

Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel\u2019s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two \u2018parent\u2019 flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a \u00be (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a \u00bc (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).  But what if one parent is homozygous with two dominant genes (XX) and the other is homozygous with two recessive genes (xx)?

Planet        Relative size of planet\u2019s diameter compared with Earth\u2019s diameter          Mercury       0.5         Venus       1         Earth       1         Mars       0.5         Jupiter       11         Saturn       9.5         Uranus       4         Neptune       4        &nbsp;   In the table above, we can see the scale of the planets compared to Earth. For example, we can see that Jupiter is the largest planet (roughly 11 times bigger than Earth), and Mercury is the smallest (rough half the size of Earth).&nbsp;      Making our planets     Now it is time to make scale models of our planets! You will be making a model of each of the eight planets in the solar system.&nbsp;    You will start with Earth. Imagine you shrink Earth to a small sphere. You will then shrink all the seven other planets by the same proportion so that they are all at the same scale. You will then be able to see the sizes of each planet relative to the size of Earth.     Aim     To find out the sizes of the planets in our solar system compared with our Earth     Materials         4 x balloons (different colours preferable)    Ruler &amp; scissors      Small amount of Play-Doh    Pen or pencil      Cardboard (enough to label all planets)    Glue or tape         Method      Using the scissors, cut out 8 small labels, one for each planet. Write the names of each of the planets on one of these labels so that they can be used to identify which model represents which planet    Start by making a sphere out of play doh with a  2 cm diameter  to represent Earth. Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Earth label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Mercury with a diameter of a little under  1 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Mercury label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Venus with a diameter of a little under  2 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Venus label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Mars with a diameter of a little under  1 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Mars label on your model    Jupiter has a diameter that is 11 times larger than Earth's diameter so, in your model, its diameter needs to be  22 cm . You will need to blow up a balloon until it has a diameter of about 22 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Jupiter label on your model    Saturn has a diameter of about  19 cm . Blow up another balloon until it has a diameter of about 19 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Saturn label on your model    Uranus has a diameter of  8 cm . Blow up another balloon (not too much) until it has a diameter of 8 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Uranus label on your model    Neptune also has a diameter of  8 cm . Blow up your last balloon until it has a diameter of 8 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Neptune label on your model    Place your model planets in the order they are listed in the table (first Mercury, then Venus, etc.). This is the order they appear in space with Mercury being closest to the Sun, and Neptune being the furthest away     Why do you think the last four planets are called the gas giants of our solar system? &nbsp;   Describe the size of the first four planets and the last four planets   Is Earth a relatively small planet or a relatively large planet?

What is the circulatory system?     All living organisms are made up of specialised cells within specialised tissues which are part of specialised organs. Every cell in our bodies needs oxygen and nutrients to function. They also need the waste that these cells produce to be removed. And that's where our circulatory system comes in.    The  circulatory system  (sometimes called the  cardiovascular system ) is a transport system that moves blood around the body.  Blood  - pumped by the  heart  and carried by  blood vessels  - provide cells with the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. It also collects and removes the waste materials that cells produce.       How the Circulatory System Works      This is the most important function our circulatory system performs. Without it, our cells would die. But our circulatory system also performs other functions. For example, it is the main way we transport heat throughout our body. This helps us stay warm and regulate our body temperature.   Someone who feels more cold than others is often said to have \u2018poor circulation\u2019.

Changes in states of matter     These three states of matter - solids, liquids, and gases - &nbsp;exist at different temperatures. This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas. This might also be called  vapourisation  if this change in state occurs above the liquid's boiling point    Condensation : when a gas or vapour turns into a liquid   There are two less common changes in state which we won't explore:     Sublimation : when a solid turns straight into a gas, without turning into a liquid first     Deposition : when a gas turns straight into a solid, without turning into a liquid first    &nbsp;     &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To demonstrate under what conditions water changes its state of matter     Materials         Water    Metal tray      Ice cubes    Oven glove      Electric kettle   &nbsp;        Method      Pass around ice cubes amongst students.

It is used to separate the particles of matter that have a  lower density  than the particles of the liquid that they are mixed in.      Density of Matter      Flotation can occur naturally (like when you drop an apple into water). But it can also occur when air or gas bubbles are created in the mixture. The bubbles will rise to the top, and the lower-density particles will attach themselves to the gas bubbles and rise with them. This separates matter suspended in a liquid by bringing it to the surface.  Flotation works best with small particles (which are small enough to attach to an air bubble).   Identify and explain which two properties of sawdust made it easy to separate it from the water and sand through flotation.
