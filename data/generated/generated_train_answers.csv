"""The correct answer to this question will depend on how fine the sand is and the size of the pores in the filter paper.If the sand is fine and the filter paper has average-sized pores, you may find that some sand gets through to the filtrate. If the sand is of average size, you should find that the filtrate is clear. This is because the sand gets caught by the microscopic sieve in the filter paper so that only the water gets through""","""The filter paper was able to separate out all of the sand from the water. The sand particles were larger than the holes in the filter paper so they were caught in the filter paper and not able to pass through into the conical flask""","The filter paper was not able to separate out all of the sand from the water perfectly. This is because filter paper has very small pores designed to allow liquids to pass through while trapping larger solid particles. However, some fine sand particles can be small enough to pass through the filter paper, especially if the sand is very fine or if the filter paper is not of high quality. Therefore, while the filter paper effectively removes a significant amount of sand, it may not capture every single grain, leading to some sand remaining in the water. This demonstrates that the effectiveness of filtration can vary based on the size of the particles and the properties of the filter used."
"""Although it seems democratic, ostracism was not necessarily fair. In source two, we see how someone voted for Aristedes to be ostracised even though they had no fair or proper reason to. In source four, we can see how citizens potentially could rig a vote by submitting multiple ostrakon""","""Ostracism was a democratic process that allowed citizens to vote to exile someone who they thought was a threat to the city. It was a way to prevent the rise of tyrants""","Ostracism in Ancient Greece was a democratic process that allowed citizens to vote for the exile of a fellow citizen for ten years, primarily to prevent tyranny and protect the state. Source 1 indicates that the procedure involved writing a name on an ostrakon and required at least 6,000 votes for the ostracism to be valid, highlighting the collective decision-making aspect of this practice.

Combining evidence from all sources, we learn that ostracism was not only a political tool but also a reflection of the citizens' fears and the desire for stability in Athens. While Source 1 provides a procedural overview, other sources may offer insights into the social implications and individual cases of ostracism, revealing how it affected community dynamics and the lives of those exiled. Overall, these sources collectively illustrate ostracism as a complex mechanism of Athenian democracy aimed at safeguarding the city-state from perceived threats."

1. **Large City**: The group representing a large city would have access to extensive resources, such as those found in Tokyo or Sydney, which have numerous services like hospitals, schools, and recreational facilities due to their high population density and economic activity.

2. **Small City**: A group representing a small city would have fewer resources compared to a large city but more than a rural town. This could be exemplified by a smaller urban area that still offers some services but lacks the extensive amenities of larger cities.

3. **Rural Town**: The group representing a rural town would have the least resources, as rural areas typically have limited access to services and facilities due to their lower population density and economic constraints. For example, rural areas in New South Wales have significantly fewer hospitals compared to Sydney.

This classification highlights the spatial differences in liveability, where accessibility to services greatly influences the quality of life in various regions."

"""Please note that the above graph is an illustration only and will not necessarily reflect the type of results that your class will get with this activity""","""Students should create a line graph that shows the change in the length of their shadows throughout the day. The graph should have an accurate title (e.g. 'Length of our shadows throughout the day'), appropriate and accurate scales (e.g. Y axis could go from 0-200cm, X axis could go from 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM), accurate plotting of data, and labels on each axis""","**Exemplar Answer:**

**Title:** Change in Shadow Length Throughout the Day

**Graph:**
- **X-axis:** Time of Day (9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM)
- **Y-axis:** Length of Shadow (in cm)

**Data Points:**
- 9:00 AM: 150 cm
- 11:00 AM: 120 cm
- 1:00 PM: 90 cm
- 3:00 PM: 110 cm

**Graph Description:**
- The graph shows a downward trend from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, indicating that the shadow length decreases as the sun rises higher in the sky. After 1:00 PM, the shadow length increases slightly by 3:00 PM.

**Analysis:**
- The shadow was shortest at 1:00 PM (90 cm) and longest at 9:00 AM (150 cm). The length of the shadow is affected by the position of the sun; as the sun moves across the sky, the angle of sunlight changes, impacting the shadow's length.

**Conclusion:**
- This graph effectively illustrates the relationship between the time of day and the length of the shadow"
"""Yes, it could as you could try to pump oil-polluted water through a filter and then release it back to the environment. This method would work best on still water such as lakes""","""Yes - if there was a small oil spill, this method could be used to help clean it up""","Yes, this method of separating oil and water could be used to help clean up oil spills. When oil spills occur, the oil floats on top of the water due to its different molecular structure, similar to how we observed in the experiment. By using a funnel and filter paper, we can effectively separate the oil from the water. 

The filter paper would trap the oil while allowing the water to pass through, as oil does not dissolve in water and remains separate. This demonstrates a reversible change, as we can remove the oil from the mixture without causing any chemical reaction. 

However, the liquid collected may not be completely clear due to small amounts of oil that can still be suspended in the water or impurities. Thus, while this method is effective for initial separation, additional steps may be needed to ensure complete cleanup of an oil spill. 

In summary, filtering is a practical technique for separating oil from water, making it a viable option for addressing oil spills."
"""The first four planets are relatively close together. The last four planets are a long way apart, especially the distance between Saturn and Uranus as well as Uranus and Neptune""","""The first four planets are relatively close together. The last four planets are much further apart from one another""","The distances of the first four planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - from the Sun are relatively close to each other, ranging from 0.4 AU (Mercury) to 1.5 AU (Mars). In contrast, the last four planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - are much farther away, with distances of 5.2 AU (Jupiter) to 30 AU (Neptune). This shows that the inner planets are significantly closer to the Sun compared to the outer planets, indicating a clear separation in their distances from the Sun. 

This pattern suggests that the solar system's structure is divided into two distinct regions: the inner rocky planets and the outer gas giants, which are spaced much farther apart."
"""The ratio of the load distance to effort distance is 1:2""","""The ratio of the load distance to effort distance is 1:2""","To determine the ratio of the load distance to effort distance in this experiment, we first need to identify the distances recorded during the trials. 

In the first trial, the 200g load was placed at the 70cm mark from the pivot, and the 100g effort was adjusted until the seesaw was balanced. If we assume the effort distance was found to be, for example, 30cm from the pivot, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

Load distance = 70cm (distance of the load from the pivot)  
Effort distance = 30cm (distance of the effort from the pivot)  

The ratio of load distance to effort distance is calculated by dividing the load distance by the effort distance:

Ratio = Load distance / Effort distance = 70cm / 30cm = 7/3 or approximately 2.33.

This means that for every 2.33 units of load distance, there is 1 unit of effort distance. 

This relationship shows that when the load distance increases, the effort distance must decrease to maintain balance, illustrating the principle of levers and mechanical advantage. Thus, we can conclude that the ratio reflects how levers can amplify force by adjusting distances from the pivot."
"""Stormwater which runs through a sediment pond will not pollute waterways as much as if it flowed straight into them via a drainpipe.&nbsp;When stormwater flows through a sediment pond, it slows down and becomes stagnant. This allows the denser sediment in the water to fall to the bottom - just like the sand in this experiment - so that it gets left behind in the basin when the water eventually continues flowing. Similarly, the water becoming stagnant allows any less dense substances to rise to the surface via floatation - like the sawdust in our experiment - so that it can be skimmed off the top of the sediment basin.This wouldn't happen if water flowed directly to the waterway in a drainpipe. This is because the water would constantly be moving, so it will continually be mixed. It won't be able to ‘stand’ - like in our experiment - so the substances in the mixture will not become separated""","""Stormwater which flows through a sediment basin would be less polluted than if it flowed straight into a waterway via a drainpipe. This is because the sediment basin allows the water to slow down and become stagnant. This means that the heavier particles (like sand or silt) will settle to the bottom of the basin, rather than flowing into the waterway. This is similar to the sedimentation and decantation experiment we did in class. The water was less polluted after we decanted it because the heavier particles had settled to the bottom of the container""","Stormwater that flows through a sediment basin would likely be less polluted than if it flowed straight into a waterway via a drainpipe. This is because the sediment basin allows for sedimentation, where heavier particles, such as sand and debris, settle to the bottom. This process is similar to the flotation experiment with sawdust, where lighter particles can be separated from heavier ones. 

In the experiment, sawdust floated due to its lower density compared to water, allowing it to be easily separated. Similarly, in a sediment basin, pollutants and larger particles can settle out of the water, reducing the overall pollution levels before the water enters the waterway. Additionally, the stagnant water in the basin provides time for contaminants to settle or be broken down by natural processes, further decreasing pollution.

Thus, the sediment basin acts as a filter, improving water quality by allowing heavier particles to settle, which would not occur if the stormwater flowed directly into the waterway."
"""Mechanical digestion breaks food into smaller pieces. By doing this, each piece of food has a greater surface area to volume ratio which allows the chemicals digesting it to do so more easily. This makes the chemical digestion of the food more efficient as there is more area of the food for them to work on""","""Mechanical digestion breaks food down into smaller pieces. This increases the surface area of the food so that the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on it more easily and efficiently""","Mechanical digestion makes chemical digestion easier and more efficient because it breaks down food into smaller pieces, increasing the surface area available for enzymes to act upon. When food is chewed and crushed, it becomes more manageable for the digestive enzymes to access and break down the complex molecules into simpler forms. For example, in the mouth, teeth grind food, and saliva begins the chemical process by breaking down carbohydrates. This initial mechanical breakdown allows enzymes, like amylase in saliva, to work more effectively on the smaller particles, leading to faster nutrient absorption in the digestive tract. Thus, mechanical digestion prepares food for chemical digestion, ensuring that nutrients are extracted efficiently for the body’s use."
"""Coming up with risk management plans to help plan responses to natural disasters; creating flood barriers or irrigation ditches; creating windbreaks""","""Ancient sites can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks""","To mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events, we can implement several strategies. Firstly, constructing protective barriers such as walls can help shield sites from strong winds and flooding. These barriers can redirect water away from vulnerable areas, reducing the risk of erosion and damage. Secondly, enhancing drainage systems around the site can prevent water accumulation, which is crucial during heavy rainfall or storms. Proper drainage helps to manage excess water and minimizes the risk of flooding.

Additionally, planting trees around the site can serve as natural windbreaks, reducing the impact of strong winds and providing shade to protect fragile structures from extreme heat. These measures not only safeguard the integrity of the site but also contribute to its long-term preservation.

In conclusion, by employing protective barriers, improving drainage, and utilizing natural vegetation, we can effectively mitigate the risks posed by extreme weather events to ancient sites."

"""Bees are a crucial part of our ecosystem because they are one of the largest pollinators of angiosperms. Bees gather pollen to stock their nests and therefore visit more plants than other pollinators who only need enough to feed themselves. This means that they carry more pollen between more plants and therefore pollinate more plants. Bees are especially important for plants that have white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers – this is because these are the colours that their eyes can most easily see, so these are the flowers they most regularly pollinate""","""Bees are such an important part of our ecosystem as they are the most effective pollinators of angiosperms. They are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are particularly important for fruit, vegetable, and nut angiosperms as they are responsible for pollinating 70% of global food crops""","Bees are a crucial part of our ecosystem primarily because they are the most effective pollinators of flowering plants, specifically angiosperms. They are responsible for pollinating about 80% of all flowering plants, which is essential for the sexual reproduction of these plants. Without bees, many angiosperms would struggle to reproduce, leading to a decline in plant diversity and health within ecosystems.

Bees are particularly important for a wide variety of angiosperms, including many fruits, vegetables, and nuts. For instance, crops such as apples, almonds, and blueberries rely heavily on bee pollination. This relationship not only supports the plants' reproductive processes but also ensures a stable food supply for humans and other animals that depend on these plants for nutrition.

In summary, bees play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by facilitating the reproduction of angiosperms, which in turn supports biodiversity and food security."
"""&nbsp;""","""Students should be able to draw a diagram showing the sieve and filter paper techniques. They should be able to include all of the labels in their diagram""","**Exemplar Answer:**

To separate the paper and sand from the water, I used two techniques: sieving and filtration. 

1. **Sieving:** First, I poured the mixture of water, sand, and paper through a sieve. The sieve caught the larger pieces of paper while allowing the sand and water to pass through. The residue collected in the sieve was the paper.

2. **Filtration:** Next, I took the sand and water mixture that passed through the sieve and poured it into a funnel lined with filter paper placed over a conical flask. The filter paper allowed the water to pass through while trapping the sand, resulting in the filtrate (clean water) in the flask and the residue (sand) remaining on the filter paper.

This is because the brain's change in motion is less sudden""","Helmets in contact sports significantly reduce the risk of concussions and brain injuries by utilizing Newton's laws of motion. 

**Using Newton's Second Law:** Concussions are less likely because helmets spread the force of impact over a longer duration. According to this law (F=ma), if the same force is applied over a longer time, the acceleration (change in motion) experienced by the head is reduced. This means the head does not stop or change direction as abruptly, lowering the risk of concussive injuries.

**Using Newton's First Law:** The brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid, and when a sudden impact occurs, it tends to continue moving due to inertia. Helmets help mitigate this by absorbing some of the impact, reducing the sudden change in motion of the head. This cushioning effect decreases the likelihood of the brain colliding violently with the skull, thus minimizing the risk of brain injury.

**Using Newton's Third Law:** When a helmet absorbs impact, it exerts an equal and opposite force back on the object that caused the impact. This means that the force transmitted to the head is lessened, reducing the chance of multiple brain injuries from repeated trauma, as the helmet effectively dissipates energy from each hit.

Overall, helmets are crucial for enhancing safety in contact sports by leveraging"
"""Bee populations are falling because of the heavy use of pesticides used in agriculture. The pesticides kill the bees or impact their ability to reproduce. Loss of habitat due to overgrazing and overpopulation is also a problem because, as more natural areas are destroyed, there are fewer wild plants for bees to feed on. I think the loss of habitat issue is the biggest problem for bees because, if it continues, there will be no habitat left for bees to thrive – and these natural environments are more important than the farmland where the pesticides are found""","""Bee populations are falling due to the use of pesticides and habitat destruction. I think habitat destruction is having the biggest impact as it removes the natural habitats that bees need to survive""","Bee populations are declining for several reasons. First, habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion reduces the natural environments where bees can thrive. This loss of habitat means fewer flowers for bees to pollinate and less nesting space for wild bee species. Second, the use of pesticides in farming poses a significant threat to bee health. Chemicals designed to kill pests can also harm bees, leading to weakened colonies and decreased reproduction rates.

I believe that habitat loss is having the biggest impact on bee populations. This is because, without suitable habitats, bees cannot find the food sources they need to survive and reproduce. Even if pesticide use is reduced, the lack of diverse and abundant flowering plants means that bees will still struggle to thrive. Therefore, addressing habitat loss is crucial for the conservation of bee populations and the ecosystems that depend on them."
